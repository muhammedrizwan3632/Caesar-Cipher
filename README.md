# Caesar-Cipher
Caesar Cipher is the first task completed during my intership at Prodigy Info Tech  . Caesar Cipher should always needed for cyber security for encrypting and decrypting the data. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher used in cryptography. It shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.


STEPS :
1. Choose any which you need to perform.
2. Enter data( eg:hello)
3. Enter any integer value for shifting data.

   FINALLY YOU GET THE RESULT.
